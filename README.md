# Deforestation_detection via fire classification

Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based classification model that can accurately identify and categorize wildfire events using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data. By analyzing temporal and spatial patterns of active fire detections and related environmental variables, the model aims to enhance the monitoring and management of wildfire incidents across diverse geographic regions. This system will support early warning mechanisms, resource allocation, and data-driven decision-making in wildfire prevention and response efforts.

Outcomes:

Heatmap of fire-triggered deforestation zones
Year-wise forest loss statistics
Alerts for high-risk areas
